    "description": "A RecyclerView can even be used inside another RecyclerView. This concept is called a nested RecyclerView. It is an instance where one RecyclerView widget is the parent to another RecyclerView widget. A good example where a nested RecyclerView widget is implemented includes the Google Play Store. Applications such as eCommerce, music apps, and movie apps such as Netflix uses this concept. In this case, the application would have one parent or the outer RecyclerView widget, which is scrollable vertically. The parent RecyclerView host child or inner RecyclerView, which is scrollable horizontally.",
