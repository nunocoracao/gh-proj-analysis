    "description": "Test DPC is a sample device policy controller for use with Android Enterprise. It gives developers the ability to see how their app will behave in a managed context such as device owner or within a managed profile. Users can set up a work profile, enable work apps, set applications restrictions, manage security polices, and much more. The app also serves as a implementation reference for other DPCs",
