    "description": "MFixedPoint is a header-only fixed-point C++ library suitable for fast arithmetic operations on systems which don't have a FPU (e.g. embedded systems).. Suitable for performing computationally intensive operations on a computing platform that does not have a floating-point unit (like most smaller embedded systems, such as Cortex-M3, CortexM0, ATmega, PSoC 5, PSoC 5 LP, PSoC 4, Arduino platforms e.t.c). Common applications include BLDC motor control and image processing. Best performance on a 32-bit or higher architecture (although 8-bit architectures should still be fine).",
