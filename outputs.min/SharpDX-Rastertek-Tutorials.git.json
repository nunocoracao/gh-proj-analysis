    "description": "This is a C# repository based off the Rastertek Tutorial Series posted on www.Rastertek.com, is a literal conversion of the C++ implementations posted on the WebSite, to a .NET C# based implementation using SharpDX 3.0.2, DirectX 11 & WinForms. This is intended for C# developers to use as a reference when trying to learn DirectX 11 3D programming, especially when most examples using DirectX are written in C++, so this repo is mimiking ALOT of common C++ DirectX style code writing but in your favorite language C#! So please unless you find an error its not intended for new contributions, its easy to run these tutorials as I have included a Winforms UI for executing every Tutorial example found on www.Rastertek.com. Enjoy!.",
