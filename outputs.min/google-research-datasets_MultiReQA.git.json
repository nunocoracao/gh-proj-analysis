    "description": "We are creating a challenging new benchmark MultiReQA: A Cross-Domain Evaluation for Retrieval Question Answering Models. Retrieval question answering (ReQA) is the task of retrieving a sentence-level answer to a question from an open corpus. MultiReQA is a new multi-domain ReQA evaluation suite composed of eight retrieval QA tasks drawn from publicly available QA datasets from the MRQA shared task. We believe that MultiReQA tests retrieval QA modelsâ€™ ability to perform domain transfer tasks. This repository hosts the codes to convert existing QA datasets from MRQA shared task to the format of MultiReQA benchmark, as well as the sentence boundary annotations for QA datasets to exactly reproduce our work. Note that we are not redistributing the content in the original datasets available on MRQA share task, but just the sentence boundary annotations.",
