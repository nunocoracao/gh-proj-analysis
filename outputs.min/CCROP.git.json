    "description": "Cover Crop Remotely Observed Performance (CCROP): The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) is interested in verifying winter cover crop implementation and analyzing cover crop productivity using satellite imagery. As they do not have the expertise on-site to automate the process, we used a combination of scripting using JavaScript in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and ArcGIS to identify suitable Landsat and Sentinel images, extract individual farm field characters (such as values for various bands, NDVI, and red-edge) to a table, and export this table. Subsequently, this table will be incorporated in the MDA agronomic database where crop and farm productivity reports can be created as needed.",
