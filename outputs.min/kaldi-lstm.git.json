    "description": "C++  implementation of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), in Kaldi's nnet1 framework. Used for automatic speech recognition, possibly language modeling etc, the training can be switched between CPU and GPU(CUDA). This repo is now merged into official Kaldi codebase(Karel's setup), so this repo is no longer maintained, please check out the Kaldi project instead.",
