    "description": "This application is an Android based travel application. Users can Login/Register on the application and their information is stored on Firebase, a cloud based NoSQL Database. When a user has logged in they are brought to their profile page, which will display their personal registration information and allow them to upload a profile picture by accessing the devices built in Camera application. The user can then select a country and retrieve information on this country compared to their current location. For example users can get information on the specified country, or locate flights to the specified country, or use a currency conversion calculator or view a map of the country. These services are provided by online REST services, such as Google Maps API, restcountries.eu API & fixer.io API. The user can then logout of the application by following the specified link or simply shaking the device.",
