    "description": "It's a sample IP location finding the website and that the website fetched the data from ipstack website. Aso, I have containerized this website and also, I included Nginx and Redis containers. Redis act as a cache and Nginx act as a load balancer server because we are using three ipstack containers for efficient working. Also, you can easily set up these containers in your environment because I wrote the above details as a docker-compose. Furthermore, the website is created using python and it's just a demonstration.",
