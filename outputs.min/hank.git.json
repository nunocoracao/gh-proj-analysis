    "description": "(DEPRECATED. This project is no longer used or maintained at LiveRamp.) Hank is a high performance distributed key-value NoSQL database that we built and use at LiveRamp. It is designed for very large data stores that dwarf the amount of available main memory and for randomly distributed read/write workloads that far exceed the capacity of memory-based caches. More specifically, it is optimized for very low latency random read queries and for very high throughput incremental batch writes.",
