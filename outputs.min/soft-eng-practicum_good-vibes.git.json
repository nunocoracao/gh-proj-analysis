    "description": "Good Vibes is an Android application developed in Unity that is an anonymous messaging app for all GGC students, alumni, faculty, and staff, in the same vein as \"Kind Words\". A server hosting a Linux build of our app on Ubuntu, running off of a Digital Ocean Droplet, as well as UNet, PHP, MySQL, and PHPMyAdmin were also used. Users are able to anonymously, send out messages on a public listing that people can send single replies to. Word filtering, reporting, and banning systems are in place. The main focus of the application according to our client is \"assisting others with mental health issues via providing a safe space to voice worries and concerns they are currently facing while also giving access to helpful resources and information.\"",
