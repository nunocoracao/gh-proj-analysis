    "description": "Django is an extremely popular open-source Python-based web framework, designed to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites with reusable pluggable components. Django has been famously used for sites such as Instagram, Mozilla, Disqus, and Clubhouse.  In this workshop, we’ll deploy Django to create our own E-commerce storefront, which allows people to buy items with or without an account, combining the use of a database with cookies for anonymous usage. Aside from Django for the core functionality, we’ll use HTML/CSS/Javascript to improve our user experience as well as integrate with the PayPal API to handle purchase payments.  Prerequisites: ✅ Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  ✅ Python (https://www.python.org/downloads)  ✅ PayPal developer account (https://developer.paypal.com/docs/get-started/)   -----------------------------------------  To learn more about The Assembly’s workshops, visit our website, social media or email us at workshops@theassembly.ae  Our website: http://theassembly.ae Instagram: http://instagram.com/makesmartthings Facebook: http://fb.com/makesmartthings Twitter: http://twitter.com/makesmartthings  #Django #PayPal #Python",
