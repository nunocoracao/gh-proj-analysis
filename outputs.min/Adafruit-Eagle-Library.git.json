This file includes some library parts from microbuilder.eu Most of 'em are either Eagle parts that I've changed a little to make them easier to solder, some are 'handmade' and a few are from microbuilder.eu  Its released into the Public Domain - that means you can do whatever you want. We'd like it if you kept the author email/url in the part description, just so we can be alerted if there are errors.  Enjoy! ",
