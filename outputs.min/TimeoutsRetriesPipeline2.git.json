    "description": "  The \"Deploy\" stage retries the flakey-deploy.sh script 3 times, and then waits for up to 3 minutes for the health-check.sh script to execute. If the health check script does not complete in 3 minutes, the Pipeline will be marked as having failed in the \"Deploy\" stage.  \"Wrapper\" steps such as timeout and retry may contain other steps, including timeout or retry.  We can compose these steps together. For example, if we wanted to retry our deployment 5 times, but never want to spend more than 3 minutes in total before failing the stage:",
