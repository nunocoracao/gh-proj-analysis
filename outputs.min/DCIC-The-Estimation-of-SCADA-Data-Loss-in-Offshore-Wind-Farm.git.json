    "description": "We extract actual SCADA data of a certain offshore wind farm and artificially remove some of the data, including but not limited to deleting all data of a certain time period, data of a certain turbine at a certain time, some fields of a certain turbine at a certain time, etc. The applicant needs to use the remaining data to recover the deleted data, and the accuracy of the recovery shall be the final evaluation benchmark",
