    "description": "The sample application to accompany my conference talk \"Enter The Matrix\" on matrix transformations.  Abstract: Matrix transformations can make your user interfaces come to life: translate, scale, and rotate.  Each on its own is relatively simple and straightforward.  Yet many developers are daunted when 2 or more operations need to be combined.  What if you need to rotate or zoom about an off-center (or even off-screen) point?  How do you combine multiple transformations into a single animation?  Learn everything you need to know to get started with complex matrix transformations in CoreGraphics and CoreAnimation. ",
