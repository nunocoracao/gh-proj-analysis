    "description": "Cloud is the new trend for the changing world. It is the step that took technology to a newer era. It is what defines today. Cloud is a simple work of a Server-Client architecture sandwiched along with Virtualization to give a prospective reality of operating the service on hand without the utilization of any resources from the client end also giving rise to a centralization for the user's data. Some common cloud products known to you may be GoogleDrive, VMware Cloud Air, HP Helion, RedHat Openstack, etc.  I have built a prototype of a cloud running on RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.4 with the three services as listed below.   1.>Software As A Service(SAAS) : Used to provide softwares to the client so that the client can use the software without actually installing the software or buying the necessary hardware to use it.  2.>Storage As A Service(STAAS) : Used to provide a storage i.e. a Pen Drive or HDD to the user which can be used to store data over the network which is accessible from any computer.  3.>Infrastructure As A Service(IAAS) : Used to provide n nos. of OS of client choice to him on the web browser.",
