    "description": "Implementation of RAISR (Rapid and Accurate Image Super Resolution) algorithm in Python 3.x by Jalali Laboratory at UCLA. The implementation presented here achieved performance results that are comparable to that presented in Google's research paper (with less than Â± 0.1 dB in PSNR). Just-in-time (JIT) compilation employing JIT numba is used to speed up the Python code. A very parallelized Python code employing multi-processing capabilities is used to speed up the testing process. The code has been tested on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X 10.13.2 platforms.",
