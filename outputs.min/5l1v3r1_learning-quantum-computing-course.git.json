    "description": "‚öõÔ∏è üí• ‚öôÔ∏è A project based in Quantum Physics/Mechanics and Quantum Computing. This projects contains Tutorials, Examples, Exercises, Papers, Posters and Illustrations covering several concepts of Quantum Physics/Mechanics and Quantum Computing, such as Quantum Information Science, Quantum Algorithms, Quantum Error Correction, Quantum Internet/Networks, Quantum Cryptography, Quantum Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum Game Theory. It works as a support for the Online Web Course of Learning Quantum Computing available in the following GitHub Page: https://rubenandrebarreiro.github.io/learning-quantum-computing. This project it's built using OpenQASM Framework (IBM's Open Quantum Assembly Language), Qiskit Framework (IBM Q Experience), Cirq Framework (Google AI Quantum), Q# Framework (Microsoft Quantum Development Kit - QDK), PyQuil Framework (Rigetti's Forest SDK), PennyLane Framework (Xanadu Quantum Technologies), Project Q Framework (ETHZ's Open-Source Software Framework for Quantum Computing) and Quantum Inspire (TU Delft's/QuTech's Quantum Computing Platform). The Tutorials, Examples and Exercises are mostly built in Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The Papers are built in TeX (LaTeX). The Posters and Illustrations are built in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. Some Tutorials, Examples and Exercises use other important Packages, Libraries and Frameworks for Data Science, Cybersecurity, Cryptography, Quantum Physics/Mechanics and Quantum Computing, such as Bokeh, Cython, Dask, Jython, Matplotlib, Numba, NumPy, PyTorch, SciKit Learn, SciPy, SymPy, TensorFlow, Theano, QuTip, or even, OpenSSL and Python's Cryptography Library. Some Examples and Tutorials also use the NetSquid and SimulaQron Simulators Frameworks (TU Delft's/QuTech's Quantum Internet's/Network Simulators).",
