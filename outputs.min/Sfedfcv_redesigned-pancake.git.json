Anyone can share their apps with other users on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} but only organizations that are verified by {% data variables.product.company_short %} can sell apps. For more information about organizations, see \"[About organizations](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations).\"  The verification process aims to protect users. For example, it verifies the seller's identity, checks that their {% data variables.product.product_name %} organization is set up securely, and that they can be contacted for support.   After passing the verification checks, any apps that the organization lists on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} are shown with a verified creator badge {% octicon \"verified\" aria-label=\"Verified creator badge\" %}.

Customers can start a free trial for any paid plan on a Marketplace listing that includes free trials. However, customers cannot create more than one free trial per marketplace product.  Free trials have a fixed length of 14 days. Customers are notified 4 days before the end of their trial period (on day 11 of the free trial) that their plan will be upgraded. At the end of a free trial, customers will be auto-enrolled into the plan they are trialing if they do not cancel.  See \"[New purchases and free trials](/marketplace/integrating-with-the-github-marketplace-api/handling-new-purchases-and-free-trials/)\" for details on how to handle free trials in your app. For more information, see: \"[Handling new purchases and free trials](/developers/github-marketplace/integrating-with-the-github-marketplace-api/handling-new-purchases-and-free-trials/).\"  {% note %}    61  content/developers/github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app.md  @@ -1,6 +1,6 @@ --- title: Requirements for listing an app intro: 'Apps on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} must meet the requirements outlined on this page before our {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} onboarding specialists will approve the listing.' intro: 'Apps on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} must meet the requirements outlined on this page before the listing can be published.' redirect_from:   - /apps/adding-integrations/listing-apps-on-github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/   - /apps/marketplace/listing-apps-on-github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/ @@ -12,49 +12,62 @@ versions:   free-pro-team: '*' ---  <!--UI-LINK: Displayed as a link on the https://github.com/marketplace/new page.-->  The requirements for listing an app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} vary according to whether you want to offer a free or a paid app.  Before you submit your app for review, you must read and accept the terms of the \"[{% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} Developer Agreement](/articles/github-marketplace-developer-agreement/).\" You'll accept the terms within your [draft listing](/marketplace/listing-on-github-marketplace/creating-a-draft-github-marketplace-listing/) on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

For more information, see \"[Security best practices for apps](/developers/github-marketplace/security-best-practices-for-apps).\"  ### Considerations for free apps  Apps will go through a security review before being listed on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. A successful review will meet the requirements and follow the security best practices listed in \"[Security review process](/marketplace/getting-started/security-review-process/).\" For information on the review process, contact [marketplace@github.com](mailto:marketplace@github.com). {% data reusables.marketplace.free-apps-encouraged %}   ### Requirements for paid apps  In addition to the requirements for all apps above, each app that you offer as a paid service on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} must also meet the following requirements:  - {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s should have a minimum of 100 installations. - {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}s should have a minimum of 200 users. - All paid apps must handle {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events for new purchases, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and free trials.

For information about how integrate these events into your app, see \"[Using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API in your app](/developers/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app).\"  To offer your app as a paid service, you'll need to meet these requirements to list your app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}: Using GitHub's billing API allows customers to purchase an app without leaving GitHub and to pay for the service with the payment method already attached to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account.  - To sell your app in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, it must use GitHub's billing system.

See \"[Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps](/apps/differences-between-apps/)\" for more details. - Apps should use the principle of least privilege and should only request the OAuth scopes and GitHub App permissions that the app needs to perform its intended functionality. For more information, see [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in Wikipedia. - Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. - Apps should not share tokens between different implementations of the app. For example, a desktop app should have a separate token from a web-based app. Individual tokens allow each app to request the access needed for GitHub resources separately. - Design your app with different user roles, depending on the functionality needed by each type of user. For example, a standard user should not have access to admin functionality, and billing managers might not need push access to repository code. - Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service. - All services used in your app should have unique login and password credentials. - Admin privilege access to the production hosting infrastructure should only be given to engineers and employees with administrative duties. - Apps should not use personal access tokens to authenticate and should authenticate as an [OAuth App](/apps/about-apps/#about-oauth-apps) or a [GitHub App](/apps/about-apps/#about-github-apps):   - OAuth Apps should authenticate using an [OAuth token](/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).   - GitHub Apps should authenticate using either a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app), [OAuth token](/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/), or [installation access token](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation).  ### Data protection  - Apps should encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate, or SSH for Git. - Apps should store client ID and client secret keys securely. We recommend storing them as [environmental variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Getting_and_setting_environment_variables). - Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with GitHub. - Apps should not require the user to provide their GitHub password. - Apps should encrypt tokens, client IDs, and client secrets.  ### Logging and monitoring  Apps should have logging and monitoring capabilities. App logs should be retained for at least 30 days and archived for at least one year. A security log should include:  - Authentication and authorization events - Service configuration changes - Object reads and writes - All user and group permission changes - Elevation of role to admin - Consistent timestamping for each event - Source users, IP addresses, and/or hostnames for all logged actions  ### Incident response workflow  To provide a secure experience for users, you should have a clear incident response plan in place before listing your app. We recommend having a security and operations incident response team in your company rather than using a third-party vendor. You should have the capability to notify {% data variables.product.product_name %} within 24 hours of a confirmed incident.  For an example of an incident response workflow, see the \"Data Breach Response Policy\" on the [SANS Institute website](https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/). A short document with clear steps to take in the event of an incident is more valuable than a lengthy policy template.  ### Vulnerability management and patching workflow  You should conduct regular vulnerability scans of production infrastructure. You should triage the results of vulnerability scans and define a period of time in which you agree to remediate the vulnerability.  If you are not ready to set up a full vulnerability management program, it's useful to start by creating a patching process.

Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not related to code, unlike issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum.  Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.  ### Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} on your repository  Repository owners and people with write access can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for a community on their public repositories.  When you first enable a {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, you will be invited to configure a welcome post.  {% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %} 1.

Click **Start discussion**.   ![\"Start discussion\" button](/assets/images/help/discussions/new-discussion-start-discussion-button.png)  ### Welcoming contributions to your discussions  You can welcome your community and introduce a new way to communicate in a repository by creating a welcome post and pin the post to your {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} page. Pinning and locking discussions helps people know that a post is meant as an announcement. You can use announcements as a way to link people to more resources and offer guidance for opening discussions in your community. For more information about pinning a discussion, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository#pinning-a-discussion).\"   ### Setting up community guidelines for contributors  You can set contributing guidelines to encourage collaborators to have meaningful, useful conversations that are relevant to the repository. You can also update the repository's README to communicate expectations on when collaborators should open an issue or discussion.  For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see \"[Adding a code of conduct to your project](/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)\" and \"[Setting up your project for healthy contributions](/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions).\"  ### Creating a new discussion  Anyone with access to a repository can create a discussion.  {% data reusables.discussions.starting-a-discussion %}  ### Organizing discussions into relevant categories  Repository owners and people with write access can create new categories to keep discussions organized. Collaborators participating and creating new discussions can group discussions into the most relevant existing categories. Discussions can also be recategorized after they are created. For more information, see \"[Managing categories for discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository)\"  ### Promoting healthy conversations  People with write permissions for a repository can help surface important conversations by pinning discussions, deleting discussions that are no longer useful or are damaging to the community, and transferring discussions to more relevant repositories owned by the organization. For more information, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository).\"  People with triage permissions for a repository can help moderate a project's discussions by marking comments as answers, locking discussions that are not longer useful or are damaging to the community, and converting issues to discussions when an idea is still in the early stages of development. For more information, see \"[Moderating discussions](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/moderating-discussions).\"  ### Next steps  Once there is a clear path to scope work out and move an idea from concept to reality, you can create an issue and start tracking your progress.

Each organization can have multiple classrooms.  After you create a classroom, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} will prompt you to invite teaching assistants (TAs) and admins to the classroom. Each classroom can have one or more admins. Admins can be teachers, TAs, or any other course administrator who you'd like to have control over your classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.  Invite TAs and admins to your classroom by inviting the user accounts on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to your organization as organization owners and sharing the URL for your classrom. Organization owners can administer any classroom for the organization. For more information, see \"[Permission levels for an organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/permission-levels-for-an-organization)\" and \"[Inviting users to join your organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization).\"  When you're done using a classroom, you can archive the classroom and refer to the classroom, roster, and assignments later, or you can delete the classroom if you no longer need the classroom.  ### About classroom rosters  Each classroom has a roster. A roster is a list of identifiers for the students who participate in your course.  When you first share the URL for an assignment with a student, the student must sign into {% data variables.product.product_name %} with a user account to link the user account to an identifier for the classroom. After the student links a user account, you can see the associated user account in the roster. You can also see when the student accepts or submits an assignment.  ![Classroom roster](/assets/images/help/classroom/roster-hero.png)  ### Prerequisites  You must have an organization account on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to manage classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.
