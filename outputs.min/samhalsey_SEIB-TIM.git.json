    "description": " To expand on previously developed IBMs, we designed a spatially explicit individual-based tick interaction model (SEIB-TIM) that varies temperature (i.e. microclimate) across the environment, does not aggregate ticks, uses hourly time steps and incorporates life-stage specific attachment rates.   We built our model for end-users who may not have a lot of coding and modeling experience but have a need for sim- ulation experiments that can mimic the habitat and wildlife host community composition unique to their study site.   The scope of this model wasis to examine the processes through which wildlife hosts,  maintain _I. scapularis_ populations within a homogeneous northeast US forest.",
