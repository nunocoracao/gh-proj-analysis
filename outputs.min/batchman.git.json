    "description": "This library for Android will take any set of events and batch them up before sending it to the server. It also supports persisting the events on disk so that no event gets lost because of an app crash. Typically used for developing any in-house analytics sdk where you have to make a single api call to push events to the server but you want to optimize the calls so that the api call happens only once per x events, or say once per x minutes. It also supports exponential backoff in case of network failures",
