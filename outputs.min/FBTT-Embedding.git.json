    "description": "This is a Tensor Train based compression library to compress sparse embedding tables used in large-scale machine learning models such as recommendation and natural language processing. We showed this library can reduce the total model size by up to 100x in Facebookâ€™s open sourced DLRM model while achieving same model quality. Our implementation is faster than the state-of-the-art implementations. Existing the state-of-the-art library also decompresses the whole embedding tables on the fly therefore they do not provide memory reduction during runtime of the training. Our library decompresses only the requested rows therefore can provide 10,000 times memory footprint reduction per embedding table. The library also includes a software cache to store a portion of the entries in the table in decompressed format for faster lookup and process.",
