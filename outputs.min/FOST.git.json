    "description": "FOST is a general forecasting tool, which demonstrate our experience and advanced technology in practical forecasting domains, including temporal, spatial-temporal and hierarchical forecasting. Current general forecasting tools (Gluon-TS by amazon, Prophet by facebook etc.) can not process and model structural graph data, especially in spatial domains, also those tools suffer from tradeoff between usability and accuracy. To address these challenges, we design and develop FOST and aims to empower engineers and data scientists to build high-accuracy and easy-usability forecasting tools.",
