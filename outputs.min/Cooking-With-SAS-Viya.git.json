    "description": "Can I use my existing SAS code in SAS Viya? What's a Cloud Analytic Server(CAS)? How's SAS 9 different from CAS. What is a Compute Server?  What is the advantage of learning to speak in SAS Viya?  These are some of the questions top of mind for the Classic  SAS 9 User   who has a solid foundation in SAS 9 & isn't sure how things integrate with existing SAS code.  Learn through the yummy analogies of  SAS instructor-yoga teacher & chef, Charu  who drew  from her experience of cooking in a yoga retreat in the Bahamas for over 300 guests  to understand the distinction between SAS & CAS. You too can learn the concepts. if techie terminology has your head all wound up in circles, then this session is just for you. Learn how you can stretch your knowledge of SAS programming concepts to beautifully write CAS code with just a few simple tweaks. All levels welcome. Some basic knowledge of SAS programming will help you get more value out of this session. ",
