    "description": "It is an ecommerce app made in for retail shops and their surrounding customers. After this app no one will hear like \"sorry mam/sir, product is not available\". In the backend it will get from more far store. This will give business to smaller business owner rather then ecommer like amazon and flipkart. This idea was brainstormed by me and with the help of my two team members we made this project. Technologies used in this project are android with java and database in firebase which is own by google.",
