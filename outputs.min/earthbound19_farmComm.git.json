Allows you to run arbitrary programs (you choose) when user is idle, invisibly,* with access to graphics hardware, whether users are logged in or not! Terminates programs when user activity resumes. \"Invisibly,\" because the program's UI does not show, but it is listed in Task Manager. Automate intensive tasks e.g. 3D renders or cryptocurrency mining.",
