    "description": "The legacy distributed object storage server developed by PitchPoint Solutions can store billions of large and small files using minimal resources. Object data is stored in replicated volumes implemented like Facebooks Haystack Object Store. Object metadata which essentially maps an object name to a volume position is stored in an elasticsearch index. (Development by PitchPoint Solutions has been discontinued)",
