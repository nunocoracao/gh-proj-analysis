    "description": "This capstone project involves machine learning modeling and analysis of clinical, demographic, and brain related derived anatomic measures from human MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests (http://www.oasis-brains.org/). The objectives of these measurements are to diagnose the level of Dementia in the individuals and the probability that these individuals may have Alzheimer's Disease (AD).  Cross-Sectional and longitudinal OASIS MRI structural and demographic data (clinical, demographic, and brain related derived anatomic measures) from human MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests (http://www.oasis-brains.org/) will be used to train a set of linear and non-linear machine learning classification models.  Pandas will be used for data loading and Python scikit-learn library for modeling. The goal is to train machine learning models to predict whether the individuals in the cross-validation set (test set) have dementia (CDR>0), and if they do, the severity level of dementia (CDR values 0.5, 1, and 2). The problem will be formulated both as a binary classification problem (CDR=0, and CDR>0) and a mult-iclass classification problem (CDR classes 0, 0.5, 1, and 2). Will Train a supervised machine learning classification model to properly classify the OASIS data according to clinical dementia ratings(CDR values). Candidate models will be chosen from the Python scikit-learn library. These models will include Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, KNN, Naive Bayes, CART, and SVM. The best model will be selected for detailed analysis of data based on the \"Accuracy\" metric.",
