    "description": "Autonomous vehicles need a way to share insight of upcoming hurdles in the road. These insights need to be secure, highly available, open to all, and owned by no one. Currently most of this data is owned by a single entity (such as Waze), and we think that OEMs don't want to rely on a monopoly.  We created a decentralized vehicle to vehicle network based on Blockchain technology.  Vehicles can share road events (traffic, accidents, etc) and also potentially notify about cyber attacks.  Each vehicle maintains its own event state. Each vehicle can add new events (blocks) to the network and notify its peers. Each vehicle creates a geographical index of all events in the network. This allows vehicles to easily retrieve nearby events.Autonomous vehicles need a way to share insight of upcoming hurdles in the road.
