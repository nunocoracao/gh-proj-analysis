    "description": "Hotter’n Hell Hundred is the largest one hundred mile cycling events in the United States and the world. Held in Wichita Falls, TX, this event brings thousands of registrants within the city limits, resulting in a spike in revenue throughout local businesses, restaurants, and hotels, and overall for the city of Wichita Falls. There are several sub-events within the Hotter’n Hell Hundred, such as different races, dining events, consumer shows and a medical symposium. The proposed Hotter’n Hell Hundred mobile application serves as the ultimate source of information for the events, enabling users to quickly register for events and explore local places. In addition, the mobile application allows users to navigate through race during the event, tracking their speed, nearby rest stops, alternate routes, and finish line, ensuring the best possible experience during their stay in Wichita Falls.",
