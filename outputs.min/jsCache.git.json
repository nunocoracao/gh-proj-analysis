    "description": "jsCache is a javascript library that enables caching of javascripts, css-stylesheets and images using my localStorage polyfill. This is especially useful when serving your website for mobile phones, which has limited HTTP caching available, but also speeds up your site in an ordinary webbrowser as it saves HTTP requests and loads all files asynchronously.",
