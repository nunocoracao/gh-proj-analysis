    "description": "The way to find the best solution for data storage is to understand what challenges need to be solved and what solutions are available in the market, according to the non-functional requirements. If the data needs to grow fast, the data schema needs to be flexible, and performance is necessary, probably NoSql DB ​​is the right solution for data storage. In this project, I compared five popular NoSql products - Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra, ElasticSearch, and CouchBase. Those products are fundamentally different from each other and can solve various use cases. Feel free to comment, star, and contribute to the project",
