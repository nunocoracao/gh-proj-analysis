    "description": "Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a powerful language which is used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. A working knowledge of databases and SQL is a must if you want to become a data scientist. The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and help me learn and apply the foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get me started with performing SQL access in a data science environment. The emphasis in this course is on hands-on and practical learning . As such, I worked with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. I created a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs I practice building and running SQL queries. I also learned how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.",
