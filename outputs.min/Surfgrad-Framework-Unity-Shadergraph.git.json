    "description": "This is a sample scene made with Unity which includes a folder of subgraphs, for shadergraph, of the surface gradient based bump mapping framework. This is a new framework which allows you to do layering/compositing of bump/normal maps including support for both multiple sets of texture coordinates as well as procedurally generated texture coordinates and geometry. Furthermore, it provides proper support and integration for bump maps defined on a volume such as parallel projections, triplanar projection and noiseâ€“based functions. The implementation is based on the paper \"Surface Gradient Based Bump Mapping Framework\". The project was made with Unity 2019.3.2f1 and hdrp+shader graph package 7.2",
