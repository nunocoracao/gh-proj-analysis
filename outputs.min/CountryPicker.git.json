    "description": "CountryPicker is a custom UIPickerView subclass that provides an iOS control allowing a user to select a country from a list. It can optionally display a flag next to each country name, and the library includes a set of 249 high-quality, public domain flag images from FAMFAMFAM (http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/) that have been painstakingly re-named by country code to work with the library.",
