    "description": "Description  During Learning Phase 2 participants in the Cloud track of the GADS 2020 program shall be encouraged to explore the possibilities and opportunities to work with the gcloud SDK more in detail.  Due to limitations in regards to accessing free Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the Google Cloud challenge is based on the available hands-on labs on Qwiklabs provided by Pluralsight. Learners in the Cloud track have free access to a selection of fundamental labs on GCP.  The playground  All Google Cloud learners have access to multiple learning channels on Pluralsight. Each channel provides access to several video courses, and you have access to various labs through Qwiklabs.   The total of hands-on labs is 168 labs (as of writing). All links are provided below as an annex.  The challenge(s)  The Cloud challenge is divided in two parts:  Complete of 10-15 selected hands-on labs on Qwiklabs and submitting proof of such per screenshot based on the email received. “Translation” of 2-3 selected labs from Console instructions to 100% command line instructions.  Submission  The result of both challenges shall be documented in a Github repository  How to get started with Github is an available course to learners via the Associate Cloud Engineer Foundational Deep Dive Channel (2020) Submit the documented github repo to the GADS Team here  - bit.ly/GADSPracticeProjectSubmission  The learning aspects  Professional cloud engineers use a lot of automation and therefore scripting of solutions instead of clicking around in the UI of the web administration. Also using git and version control to store and monitor those scripts is a common use case.  Learners are gently guided towards this professional handling using both approaches. The translation of Cloud Console instructions to easy to use commands in the Cloud Shell helps to foster the understanding and knowledge of cloud computing in GCP.  Selection of labs shall be based on the curriculum and official study guide of the ACE exam as described by Google on their certification website.  Furthermore Qwiklabs hosts Speedrun competitions regularly and promotes them on Twitter and Medium. Without knowledge and use of CLI tools participants cannot compete in those Speedruns.  Engagement of learners  Cloud learners are requested to complete the requested tasks and then finally submit their public repository on Github via Google Forms back to us. Well, the repository could be sent back to us first. ;-)  All three tasks are deemed to engage learners in the available Slack channels. Whether it’s the general #cloud channel or their associated PLG channel. This shall lead to a vital exchange of knowledge and tips on how to handle instructions as written commands in the Cloud Shell.",
